# Why I Refuse to Call It a Joshua Tree

## 2023/11/25

We parked our campervan near the Cholla Cactus Garden in _Joshua Tree_ National Park, gazing upon the breathtaking view of the pristine plain, surrounded by majestic mountains and rocks. It felt as if I had traveled back hundreds of thousands of years. Similarly at _Zion_ National Park, everywhere I go was the awe-inspiring sight of mountains, stars, and valleys. It felt as if I were looking at the landscape through the eyes of the Native Americans from bygone days who must have had similarly deep appreciation for the view. However, the more I love these places, the more I believe we should call them differently. 

### It's Not "Joshua Tree"

For thousands of years, many different native American groups embraced this giant Yucca tree as a spiritual reference and valued resource. Southern Paiute called it "**sovarampi**". Cahuilla Indians referred to it as "**humwichawa**" and the Western Shoshone knew it simply as "**umpu**". Shouldn't we consider using one of these Native American names as a way to show respect for their long connection to the land? 

At the very least, using a completely unrelated biblical name **Joshua** seems out of context for this desert in California. Apparently, the name "Joshua tree" was given by a group of Mormon settlers who crossed the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century. Holding onto this new Mormon name not only shows disrespect to the Native Americans who inhabited the region for millennia but also perpetuates the violence of colonialism for future generations. Similar to the increased attention given to pronouns, name matters. Understanding more about names in Native American culture can prevent the repetition of similar tragedy that native americans had in the future.

If choosing any one of the Native American names is hard, the tree honestly looks more like a dragon tail or caterpillar. And I called it "Dragon Tail Tree" the whole time I was there.

### Same goes Zion and more

Similarly Zion National Park was called "Mukuntuweap" for thousands years, even until 1917. This transition from Mukuntuweap to Zion seems ridiculous. This is America, not Jerusalem. And to be honest, more than 50% of the Americans are not that religious anyway ([gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx)). Then why should every mountain peak at Zion be so uncomfortably Christian like Angels Landing, Temple of Sinawava, Abraham, Isaac... If changing a name is this easy, maybe we should change it back to its original name that was called by original settlers for thousands of years.

Or, at the very least, maybe we can consider a different, more neutral name. _Mt. Ryan_ in Joshua Tree National Park looked more like a rhino to me. We might as well call it Rhino Peak.
