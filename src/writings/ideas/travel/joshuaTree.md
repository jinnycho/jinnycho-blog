# Why I Refuse to Call It a Joshua Tree

## 2023/11/25

We parked our campervan near the Cholla Cactus Garden in Joshua Tree National Park, gazing upon the breathtaking view of the pristine plain, surrounded by majestic mountains and rocks. It felt like I time-travelled back to hundreds of thousands of years ago. I felt similarly impressed with Zion National Park, where I can imagine the native Americans running and loving the place around. As much as I love this place, I think we should call it differently.
