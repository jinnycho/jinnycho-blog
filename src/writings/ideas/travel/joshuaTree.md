# Why I Refuse to Call It a Joshua Tree

## 2023/11/27

We parked our campervan near the Cholla Cactus Garden in _Joshua Tree_ National Park, gazing upon the breathtaking view of the pristine plain, surrounded by majestic mountains and rocks. It felt as if I had traveled back hundreds of thousands of years. Similarly at _Zion_ National Park, everywhere I go was the awe-inspiring sight of mountains, stars, and valleys. However, the more I love these places, the more I believe we should call them differently. 

### It's Not "Joshua Tree"

For thousands of years, many different native American groups embraced this giant Yucca tree as a spiritual reference and valued resource. Southern Paiute called it "**sovarampi**". Cahuilla Indians referred to it as "**humwichawa**" and the Western Shoshone knew it simply as "**umpu**". Shouldn't we consider using one of these Native American names as a way to show respect for their long connection to the land? 

At the very least, using a biblical name **Joshua** seems out of context for this desert in California. Apparently, the name "Joshua tree" was given by a group of Mormon settlers who crossed the Mojave Desert in the mid-19th century. Holding onto this Mormon name not only shows disrespect to the Native Americans who inhabited the region for millennia but also perpetuates the ignorance of colonialism for future generations.

If choosing any one of the Native American names is hard, the tree honestly looks more like a dragon tail or caterpillar. So I called it "Dragon Tail Tree" the whole time I was there.

### Same goes to Zion and more

Similarly Zion National Park was called "Mukuntuweap" for thousands of years, even until 1917. This transition from Mukuntuweap to Zion is really strange. This is America, not Jerusalem. And to be honest, more than 50% of the Americans are not that religious anyway ([gallup](https://news.gallup.com/poll/341963/church-membership-falls-below-majority-first-time.aspx)). Then why should every mountain peak at Zion be so uncomfortably Christian like Angels Landing, Temple of Sinawava, Abraham, Isaac... If changing a name is this easy, maybe we should change it back to its original name that was called by original settlers for thousands of years.

Jinhae is my hometown in South Korea. It used to be called 'Gomnae,' which is a pure Korean name meaning "streams for bears". However, it was suddenly changed to Jinhae during the Japanese occupation, a name that means 'conquering the sea' in Japanese. It's disheartening to see these beautiful names with profound and affectionate meanings erased by colonialists for their convenience and values. Perhaps that's why transitions like those to Joshua Tree or Zion came more personal to me. Because names have power.
