# Why I Refuse to Call It a Joshua Tree

## 2023/11/25

We parked our campervan near the Cholla Cactus Garden in Joshua Tree National Park, gazing upon the breathtaking view of the pristine plain, surrounded by majestic mountains and rocks. It felt like I time-travelled back to hundreds of thousands of years ago. Similarly at Zion National Park, everywhere I go was the awe-inspiring sight of mountains, sky and valleys. It felt as if I were taking a look at the landscape through the eyes of the Native Americans back in the days, who must have had similarly deep appreciation for the view before me. As much as I love these places, I strongly think we should call them differently.
