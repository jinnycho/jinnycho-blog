# Company Of One
## 2023/11/07

When I was in high school, I wrote an essay about how much I love small, local bakeries over large franchise chains like 'Paris Baguette,' which probably don't even use any ingredients from France & significantly less tasty. This book has reignited my drive to seek greater meaning in my life - should I start my small yet high-quality business?

### Growth is Overrated!
> There's no such thing as perpetual growth. Yet that's what traditional business people crave. But what is growth meant to achieve? If Oxford University is so successful, then why isn't there a branch in Washington, D.C? If a symphony is successful with 120 musicians, why not even more so with 600? "To grow bigger" is not much of an effective business strategy at all.

> Blind growth is the main cause of buisness problems. It can leave you with an unmaintainable number of employees, unsustainable cost, and more work than hours in a day. It can force you to lay off employees, sell your company at a less than optimal price, or, even worse, close up shop completely.

> For a company of one at any size, simple rules, simple processes, and simple solutions typically win. ... After a few years of adding steps here and there, a task once took a handful of steps now requires sign-off by 6 depertment heads, a legal review, and a dozen or more meetings with stakeholders.

When I see recent layoffs in multiple companies, I wonder why they needed 90,000 people in the first place. The problem of over-growth is also something I've personally encountered during my time at several companies. I remember things were more effective, creative or at the very least more enjoyable, when there were fewer people.

The myth that more people will fix more problems is debatable; it might just cause more unnecessary coordinations, take much more time to make any decisions, and create the feeling that there are more people managing staffs than actual engineers.

### Autonomy is Creativity 

> The word "intrapreneur" points to one example of a company of one within a larger organization. It describes corporate leaders who come up with their own goals and then execute them. They don't need much direction, micromanaging, or oversight, as they've been given full work autonomy. They know what needs doing and they just do it.

> Many large corporations have companies of one hiding within them. If the skills and passion for innovation and autonomy of these employees are fostered, it can greatly benefit the entire business as a whole. But if they are stifled in their creativeness and freethinking, they tend to move on quickly to other employemnt or entrepreneurialism.

> But to achieve autonomy as a company of one, you have to be a master at your core skill set. Competence and autonomy are tied together.

> The problem is not so much employees taking advantage of perks like flex hours or remote work, but leaders assuming that they need to give less direction. A leader's job is to provide clear direction and then get out of the way.

When I was in the woodworking class, I find myself & many other people becoming significantly more creative. We can make basically anything from a simple piece of wood. We have a full agency to ideate and bring those ideas to life - anything from a wooden table with a built-in phone charger to a fully modular desk system that can hold a record player.

I think the company of one or any company should learn from woodworking. Just like how we learn the ropes of using a table saw, we should still have certain guidelines/values to follow. But at the end of the day, we should be free to run with our ideas and make them happen.

### You Can't Quantify Everything
> success can be personally defined, and that while profit and sustainability are absolutely important to a business, they aren't the only driving forces, metrics, or factors in business success.

This is something I've been thinking a lot too. Many values can't be easily quantified. Companies often obsess over immediate 'data' like sales or profits. However, there are aspects that provide subtle satisfaction to users, which may not yield shiny data immediately but are beneficial in the long run. For example, I believe one of the reasons Amazon has so many loyal customers is its extremely easy return policy. Although this policy might harm the company's profits in the short term, it has garnered the trust of many users. Can we easily quantify this impact? I don't think so. Such decisions are often based more on our intuition and empathy. Sometimes, we need to look at the forest rather than focusing on the trees.

### Multitask is Overrated
> We now incorrectly assume that we must have numerous priorities and multitask to get ahead in business, even though working this way can deeply affect (and hurt) our productiviy.

> Attempting to focus on more than one priority at at ime reduces productivity by as much as 40 percent ... Creating the image of busyness may be all the rage in startup and corporate culture, but the busier we are, the less space we have to think and be cretive in solving the problems that companies of one need to solve.

> Glei sugegests doing a productiviy audit once or twice a year: for a week or two, record what tasks you're working on, for how long, and where the big distractions lie. ... even create a "stop doing" list.

> You need to learn how to elicit a strong emotional response to your business, and the personality of your brand, beecause while it's easy to forget or lose interest in information, it's much harder to forget strong emotion.

In workplace, you have to be relentless in protecting your own schedule and workload; otherwise, you'll end up juggling ten meetings and five projects, leaving you unable to work on anything more deeply or efficiently. What's worse is that people consider it a good thing. Once again, woodworking is teaching me a different lesson â€“ being organized and focusing on one thing at a time is crucial. If you're doing bandsawing in one hand and sanding in the other, you are going to lose your finger.

### Working More Does Not Mean Better
> Decision making can be mentally taxing and draining, and when that happens, many people start to make bad decisions because they're tired of deciding. By scaling down large, stressful decisions into smaller, more digestible decisions, you can choose a direction more quickly, in a smarter way, and with less stress involved.

> Hansson despises this paradigm of working more as the only way to be succesful. ... Companies need to stop hustling and should encourage their employees to focus on accepting that there's life outside of work, that there's real usefulness to sleep and recuperation, and that their work habits should be much calmer.

This also happens a lot in the workplace and goes hand in hand with the myth of multitasking. If I take on a managerial role, I will ensure that people focus on one task at a time, trust their judgment, and avoid overworking. The goal is to complete one task well and leave work early. If someone is struggling to perform well, I tend to think it's because of the system rather than the individual. I'd question whether the person's role is too vague or if they're juggling too many tasks simultaneously. It's also possible that the goals are unreasonably high. 

Overworking & lack of agency is a good recipe for people to make mistakes and feel burned out, which ultimately leads to decreased creativity, efficiency, and morale.

### Resilience

> Being or becoming a company of one has a lot to do with resilience: the capacity and fortitude to recover quickly from difficulties.

> The first trait that resilient people have is an acceptance of reality. They don't need for things to be a certain way and don't engage in wishful thinking ... They have a down-to-earth view that most of what happens in our lives is not entirely within our control and the best we can do is to steer the boat a little as we float down the river of life. The second characteristic of resilient people is a sense of purpose - being motivated by a sense of meaning rather than by just money. The last trait of resilient people in a company of one is the ability to adapt when things change - because they invariably do.

> These traits for resilience are absolutely learnable.

One thing that's different from buddhism is they don't tell people that there's a "heaven" and 

### Empathy
> Power is a tumor that ends up killing its victims' sympathies ... The qualities that lead to the leadership roles we achive are the exact qualities that diminish once leadership roles are attained ... Any leaders who listen carefully and are receptive to smart and useful suggestions from their team, whether they're introverted ro not, can build the trust required to earn cooperation.

> Empathy is feeling with people ... In many quickly growing companies, however, leaders feel that they are required to detach from human relationships and focus on using people as resources to achieve necessary growth by any means necessary. The problem is that a leader who stops feeling what is either motivating or demotivating within their team stops being able to lead.

> attention is the most important currency anyone can give a business, and that attention is worth more than revenue or possessions.


### Right Mindset & Value
> To succeed as a company of one, you have to have a real underlying purpose.

> Company's success isdue to being a "responsible" company ... We're talking about who you work with, what you offer, where you focus your time and energy, and even how you define your audience. If your business is fully aligned with your purpose, you'll be more motivated to keep at it, even during the tough moments.

> Purpose-based, values-driven companies outperform their counterparts in stock prices by a factor of twelve ... Your purpose is what drives you to succeed and defines what success is. It's not so much what you do as how and why you do it.

### Should We Believe in Passion?
> Purpose and passion are quite different.

> Newport believese that we need to be craftspeople, focused on getting better and better at how we use our skills ... The craftsperson mind-set keeps you focused on what you can offer the world; the passion mind-set focuses instead on what the world can offer you.

> Her passion came after her hard work - as a result of it - not the other way around. ... Passion doesn't preced mastery, but follows it.

> Engaging work comprises four key components: clearly defined assignments, tasks you excel at, performance feedback, and work autonomy.

> It's far easier to simply work at getting really good at something in demand, discovering how those skills can be applied to something else, and then testing your idea in a small way to see if it will pay.

### Courage To Be Disliked 
> being vanilla isn't going to allow you or your work to stand out

> showing an audience why they should believe in what you're marketing enough to want it at any cost, simply because they agree with what you're doing.

> we should proudly exclude people, because we can't please everyone. ... if we try to appeal to everyone, we won't appeal to anyone in particular, muddying our message. ... "one size fits all" approach rarely works and often leads to mediocrity.

> To be a polarizing company of one, you can look into 3 strategies. The first if _placation_: trying to change the minds of the so-called haters, ... the second strategy is _padding_: by intentionally antagonizing haters, you may sway neutral customers into becoming supporters ... the third strategy is _amplification_: singling out a single characteristic and leaning heavily on it.

### But Keeping my Customers Happy
> resounding number of profitable innovations within companies have originated with customers.

> Companies of one need to turn complaints into opportunities to do better and use them to attempt to build closer relationships with the customers who stick around.

> businesses with a culture of keeping their word are much more profitable than those that go back on their word or only say things that don't align with their actions. ... The first strategy is to make fewer and better commitments to customers. ... should track its commitments ... leaving actual processes in place to meet these commitments is required.

> At the core of many massive, profitable, global companies is an old idea executed exceptionally well.


### Teaching
> To stand out and build an audience as a company of one, you have to out-teach and outshare the competition, not outscale them.

> Customer education - providing an audience with the knowledge, skills, and abilities to become an informed buyer - is one of the most important parts of a sales cycle. ... The more those clientes were educated on the pros and cons of the financial products the investment firm offered, the more they trusted that firm, the more loyalty to the firm they developed, and the more appreciative they became of the firm's customer service for taking the time to educate them.

> Teach everything you know and don't be afraid to give away your best ideas.
