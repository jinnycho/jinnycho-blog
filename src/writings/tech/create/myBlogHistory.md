# The Evolution of My Blogging Journey
## 2023/10/15
Believe it or not, my blogging history goes back 5 years, with changes almost every year. I wanted to share my likes, dislikes, and how I created my all-time favorite version.

### What I was looking for
1. I want my blog to look unique & well designed.
2. I want to write many blogs that are well organized.
3. I'd love to have full control to add or change things on my blog as I go. (e.g. subscription)

### Version 1 ★☆☆☆☆
I used a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). It was very well-documented and easy to set up with many interesting templates to choose from. The blog itself was loaded fast too. However, it was quite tricky to customize anything (at least at that time). All the 'templates' they offered were quite boring as well, to be honest. I didn't feel attached to it and quickly grew bored over time; it felt more like mass-produced IKEA furniture rather than a handmade piece, if that makes sense.
### Version 2 ★★☆☆☆
