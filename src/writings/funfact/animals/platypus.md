Did you know that platypuses are missing this major organ, and they don't have nipples? I'll tell you more! :P

### 1. People didn't believe it was real

English zoologist George Shaw first wrote about the platypuses in 1799 with some notes & a specimen. Nobody believed it was real and tried to find the stitches around the beak.

### 2. The beak is goddamn powerful

What appears to be a beak is actually part of its skull. And apparently it's quite soft in the middle.

This beak is not only aesthetically cute but also very powerful. It allows platypuses to detect underwater prey using electrical impulses to locate objects in the deepest and darkest of waters. This is why platypuses close their eyes, ears—everything—when hunting. They fully focus on their beaks.
