# Fun Facts of Platypus
## 2023/11/29

Did you know that platypuses are missing this major organ, and they don't have nipples? I'll tell you more! :P

### 1. People didn't believe it was real

English captain John Hunter first wrote about the platypuses in 1797 with some sketches & a specimen. Nobody believed it was real.

### 2. Its beak is goddamn powerful

What appears to be a beak is actually part of its skull. And apparently it's quite soft in the middle.

This beak is not just aesthetically cute; it's also incredibly powerful. It allows a platypus to detect underwater prey using electrical impulses (a.k.a electroreception) to locate objects in the deepest and darkest of waters. This is why platypuses often close their eyes when moving because they use their beaks.

But unfortuantely it doesn't have teeth. So it must scoop up bits of gravel with its food to help “chew” its meal. XD

### 3. But it doesn't have stomach
It's unclear why they lack a stomach, but indeed, platypuses are one of the two mammals that don't have a stomach. Perhaps their diet makes a stomach unnecessary.

### 4. And they don't have nipples
As egg-laying mammals, platypuses also have a unique method for nursing their babies. They don't have nipples. They "sweat" milk through specialized glands in the skin. 

Because of this strange feeding system, which can be challenging for babies, platypuses have developed milk with highly antibacterial properties and extremely high iron content. Scientists are trying to solve the global superbug threat with platypuses' milk. Go platypuses!

### 5. And they're venomous too
Male platypuses have spurs that are connected to a venom gland. It is lethal enough to kill a medium-sized dog but not humans (though it's still excruciatingly painful & there is no antivenom so be careful). The venom is more plentiful during the breeding season, leading scientists to believe that it is used to defend mates and resources from rival males.

### 6. They can drown pretty easily
Even though it sounds like they're a badass animal, they can drown pretty easily. Normally, a platypus stays underwater for between 1 and 2 minutes. So "Opera house” nets that people set to catch crayfish and yabbies can be death traps for platypuses. BE CAREFUL!

### 7. They are biofluorescent
Under the UV light, they are all glowing. Scientists think it's probably because they're nocturnals so being biofluorescent help them see & communicate each other.

### 8. Last but not least, they maintain a stable body heat
Its fur is waterproof and traps an insulating layer of air to keep its body temperature stable, even in cold water.

Isn't it incredible that there is a semi-aquatic, egg-laying, venomous, electrolocating, milk-sweating, biofluorescent, stomachless, teethless, temperature-controlled animal that's also super adorable?
