# Fun Facts of Platypus
## 2023/11/29

Did you know that platypuses are missing this major organ, and they don't have nipples? I'll tell you more! :P

### 1. People didn't believe it was real

English zoologist George Shaw first wrote about the platypuses in 1799 with some notes & a specimen. Nobody believed it was real and tried to find the stitches around the beak.

### 2. The beak is goddamn powerful

What appears to be a beak is actually part of its skull. And apparently it's quite soft in the middle.

This beak is not only aesthetically cute but also very powerful. It allows platypuses to detect underwater prey using electrical impulses (a.k.a electroreception) to locate objects in the deepest and darkest of waters. This is why platypuses close their eyes a lot because they don't need them.

But unfortuantely they don't have teeth. So they must scoop up bits of gravel with its food to help “chew” its meal. XD

### 3. But they don't have stomach
It's unclear why they lack a stomach, but indeed, platypuses are one of the two mammals that don't have a stomach. Perhaps their diet makes a stomach unnecessary.

### 4. And they don't have nipples
As egg-laying mammals, platypuses also have a unique method for nursing their babies. They don't have nipples. They "sweat" milk through specialized glands in the skin. 

Because of this strange feeding system, which can be challenging for babies, platypuses have developed milk with highly antibacterial properties and extremely high iron content. Scientists are trying to battle the global superbug threat with platypuses' milk. Go platypuses!

### 5. But they're venomous lol
Male platypuses have spurs that are connected to a venom gland. It is lethal enough to kill a medium-sized dog but not humans (though it's still excruciatingly painful & no antivenom so you just gotta suffer). The venom is more plentiful during breeding season, leading scientists to believe that it is used to defend mates and resources from rival males.

### 6. They can drown
Even though they're aquatic animals, they can drown pretty easily. Normally, a platypus stays underwater for between one and 2 minutes. So "Opera house” nets that people set to catch crayfish and yabbies can be death traps for platypuses. BE CAREFUL!
