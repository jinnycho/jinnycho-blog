# Fun Facts About Honey Badger
## 2023/12/02

Did you know that the Guinness Book of Records named this animal as the most fearless animal. They are true fighters - bees, crested porcupines, cobras, scorpions, leopards, and even lions - they are eager to pick a fight with anyone.

### 1. They are small

The honey badgers are compact, typically measuring around 9 to 11 inches in height at the shoulder and weighing between 20 to 35 pounds. This is about the size of a large corgi.

### 2. They like honey

Just as the name suggests, honey badgers like honey. And they can surely survive bee stings. Their coarse hair, loose fitting skin, and fat layer make them highly impervious. Honestly, knifes and spears won’t penetrate either so don't use them. It'll just make the badger even more pissed. Additionally, they basically fart to attack the bees. And voila, they get their hands on the tasty honey.

One fun fact is badgers can't properly digest beeswax. But they don't care.

### 3. They eat porcupines
These African crested porcupines boast lengthy, sharp quills that are basically arrows that have been known to injure or even kill lions, leopards, hyenas, and humans.

But of course, our badgers will not surrender.

### 4. They eat (deadly) snakes

Our relentless honey badgers have developed immunity over their life time after numerous small injetcions of venom from bees, scorpions, and snakes.

The snakes they eat are not just average venomous snakes though. They are one of the deadliest snakes on earth. It only takes two drops of black mamba venom to kill an adult human, and a single bite from a King Cobra can take down an elephant.

Our honey badgers are not afraid. They usually attack the snake's head, fall into a deep, hour long sleep, then wake up all refreshed to finish the rest of the snake.

### 5. They are smart
The world is unfair because they're very smart too. A lot of shelters have been having hard time because they keep escaping using any available tool. Some people think they might be one of the smartest animals.
