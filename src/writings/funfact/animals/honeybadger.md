### 1. It is small

The honey badger is a compact mammal, typically measuring around 9 to 11 inches in height at the shoulder and weighing between 20 to 35 pounds. This is about the size of a large corgi.

### 2. And it eats honey

Just as the name suggests, honey badgers eat honey. And they can surely survive bee stings. Their coarse hair, loose fitting skin, and fat layer make them highly impervious to bee stings. On top of that, it is known that they basically fart to attack the bees. And voila, they get their hands on the delicious honey.

 On top of that, they have developed immunity over their life time after numerous small injetcions of venom from bees, scorpions, and snakes.
