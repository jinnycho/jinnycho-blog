### 1. It is small

The honey badger is a compact mammal, typically measuring around 9 to 11 inches in height at the shoulder and weighing between 20 to 35 pounds. This is about the size of a large corgi.

### 2. It eats honey

Just as the name suggests, honey badgers eat honey. And they can surely survive bee stings. Their coarse hair, loose fitting skin, and fat layer make them highly impervious to bee stings. On top of that, they basically fart to attack the bees. And voila, they get their hands on the delicious honey.

### 3. It eats (deadly) snakes

Our relentless honey badgers have developed immunity over their life time after numerous small injetcions of venom from bees, scorpions, and snakes.

The snakes that honey badgers eat are not just normal snakes though. They are one of the deadliest snakes on earth. It only takes two drops of black mamba venom to kill an adult human, while a single bite from a King Cobra can take down an elephant.

They typically go for the head when attacking snakes, but getting bitten is inevitable. However, they just have a deep sleep for an hour or two, then wake up all refreshed to finish the rest of the snake.
