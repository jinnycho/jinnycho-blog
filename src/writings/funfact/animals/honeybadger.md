# Fun Facts About Honey Badger
## 2023/12/02

Did you know that the Guinness Book of Records named this animal as the most fearless animal? They are true fighters - bees, porcupines, cobras, scorpions, leopards, lions, you name it. The tales of honey badger's sheer audacity have become the stuff of legend.

### 1. They are small

The honey badgers are compact, typically measuring around 22 ~ 27cm (9 ~ 11 inches) in height at the shoulder, 55 ~ 77cm (20 ~ 30inches) in width, and weighing between 5.5 ~ 16kg(12 ~ 35lb). This is about the size of a large corgi.

### 2. They eat honey

Just as the name suggests, honey badgers like honey. And they can surely survive bee stings. Their coarse hair, loose-fitting skin, and fat layer make them highly impervious. For the record, knifes and spears won’t penetrate either, so don't use them. It'll just piss them off.

Another fun fact is badgers can't properly digest beeswax. But they still eat them.

### 3. They eat porcupines
These African crested porcupines boast lengthy, sharp quills that are very lethal. They have been known to injure or even kill lions, leopards, hyenas, and humans.

But of course, our badgers will not surrender.

### 4. They eat (deadly) snakes

Our relentless honey badgers have developed immunity over their life time after numerous small injetcions of venom from bees, scorpions, and snakes.

The snakes they eat are not just average snakes though. They are one of the deadliest snakes on earth. It only takes two drops of black mamba venom to kill an adult human, and a single bite from a King Cobra can take down an elephant.

Our honey badgers don't give a sh*t. They usually attack the snake's head, fall into a deep, hour long sleep, then wake up all refreshed to finish the rest of the snake.

### 5. They eat basically everything
The honey badgers are known to eat 60 different species. Their prey includes underground, venomous, underwater, flying, or tree-dwelling creatures, some of which are 100 times bigger than their size.

### 6. They are smart
Thanks to their diverse diet, honey badgers are trained to be remarkable problem solvers & possibly the top innovator in Africa. One true story - Stoffle, a rescued honey badger, escaped its shelter using wood, stone, and mop. When the caretaker removed almost everything, the honeybadger used dirt to make its escape.
