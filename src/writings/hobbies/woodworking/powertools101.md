# Woodworking - Power Tools 101
## 2023/11/09

Finished my intro to woodworking class (specifically power tools) from [Makeville studio](https://makeville.com). I made a small cherry tree side table from scratch featuring bridle joints and a round top. In short, I loved it! Steve Ceraso, who was my instructor, was very friendly, and the studio itself was really well-furnished and organized. I'd like to write about some of the main tools and techniques I learned during this class.

This is what I made:

## 1. Milling Lumber
People like to mill lumber because it's cheaper and gives them more control over the material. One pro tip was **chalk** was so good in this process. It was better than a pencil because it's easier to erase and simply nicer.

### 1.1 Miter Saw
We used it to cut a large piece of wood into smaller pieces. This is ideal for cross-cutting, which means cutting the wood against the grain direction.

### 1.2 Jointer
