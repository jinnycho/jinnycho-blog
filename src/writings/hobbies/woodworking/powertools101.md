# Woodworking - Power Tools 101
## 2023/11/09

Finished my intro to woodworking class (specifically power tools) from [Makeville studio](https://makeville.com). I made a small cherry tree side table featuring bridle joints and a round top. In short, I loved it! Steven, who was the instructor, was very friendly, and the studio itself was very well-furnished and organized. I'd like to write about some of the main tools and techniques I used during this class.
