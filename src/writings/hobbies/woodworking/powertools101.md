# Woodworking - Power Tools 101
## 2023/11/23

Finished my intro to woodworking class (specifically power tools) from [Makeville studio](https://makeville.com). I made a small cherry tree side table from scratch featuring bridle joints and a round top. In short, I loved it! Steve, who was my instructor, was very friendly, and the studio itself was really well-furnished and organized. I'd like to write about some of the main tools and techniques I learned during this class.

First of all, this is what I made:

## 1. Milling Lumber
People like to mill rough lumber because it's cheaper and gives them more control over the material. One pro tip from Steve was to use a **chalk** in this process. It was better than a pencil because it's easier to erase and simply nicer to use.

### 1.1 Miter Saw
We used it to cut a large piece of wood into smaller pieces. This is ideal for cross-cutting, which means cutting the wood against the grain direction. This is relatively rough cut so it shouldn't have to be very accurate.

<span style="color:blue">Some Tips</span>
- Do not use the miter saw to cut small pieces.
- We need to position ourselves to the left of the miter saw, and we'll use the board on the left.
- If the lumber is not completely flat, make sure the bow is correct so it doesn't wobble.
- The hand should be on the machine.


### 1.2 Jointer

It is a specialized tool that can create smooth, straight edges and flat surfaces in woodworking projects.

<span style="color:blue">Some Tips</span>
- Adjust the depth correctly; you don't want to cut too deep. It's better to make multiple shallow cuts instead (about 3 times).
- Double check the red part is working properly. It has to work.
- Use 2 pushsticks!
- Turn on the dust collector.

### 1.3 Thicknesser

It is a tool to trim boards to a consistent thickness throughout their length and flat on both surfaces.

## 2. Table Saw

Table saws cut straighter lines and make smoother cuts on small and long boards. It IS dangerous so it's always better to have a "saw stop" attachment. Table saw can do both rip-cut (cutting along the grain direction) & cross-cut. Rip-cut blade is bigger than that of cross-cut. Always be careful with the kickback!

<span style="color:blue">Some Tips</span>
- It could tear the fibers on the bottom part of the wood. Do it more slowly.
- Make sure the blade is upright and square. To check, remove the cover and adjust the angle.
- The edge of the blade shouldn't be significantly higher than the height of the wood; it should be approximately the same height.
- To avoid kickback, stand close to the left of the machine & make sure the left hand stays. Also Hold the wood when turning on the machine.
