# Jinhae
## 2024/01/02

Yes. This is my hometown. My goal is to share my fellow readers what could be the most exceptional city in South Korea that not many people know. I will share both pros and cons of this city, as well as some recommendations.

### Pros
1. **Beautiful Mountains**: This city is surrounded by handsome mountains that are very easily accessible. You can find several trails by walk.

2. **Beautiful Ocean View**: The city is also located on the oceanfront. The ocean here is quite clean and abundant in fish, to the point where locals have joked that the navy has been mostly fighting with the local fishermen. The sight of the ocean during sunset is truly majestic, and I particularly enjoy the fact that it's part of an archipelago rather than just a single body of water because each island I see is so fluffy and cute.

3. **Walkable City**: It is the first planned city in Korea during the Japanese occupation. Although the occupation itself is tragic and should never happen again, Japan designed the city quite well. Each neighborhood is gridded pretty well so it's easier to navigate and the whole city is walkable.

4. **Cherry Blossom Trees**: Cherry blossom trees are EVERYWHERE in Jinhae. Apparently, there are around 360,000 trees throughout the city, and they are truly beautiful and plump.

5. **Not Many Ugly Apartment Buildings**: One of the most unfortunate aspects of Korean cities is the abundance of unattractive, cookie-cutter, tall apartment buildings that lack any style or character. While Jinhae does have its fair share of them as well, due to height regulations imposed by the naval base, there are mostly shorter apartments. Shorter apartment buildings are actually quite cute and nice.

6. **People**: Jinhae is a naval city. It has the national Naval Academy, an American naval base, a Korean naval base, and several training centers. I bet 80% of the of the population has some connection to the navy. Possibly due to its stability, most of the people in Jinhae are neither rich nor poor. I don't think there's any homeless issue. Lots of people I met still have 'Jeong,' a quality that many Korean people used to have (it's like generosity and benevolence), especially when compared to people in much larger cities like Seoul.

7. **Railroads Across the City**: Even though people can't use the railroads, they add a nice touch to the city, and sometimes you'll spot a train moving around, maybe carrying some military equipments. It's a great place to walk along too. 

8. **Animals**: Since it's a seaside town, there are lots of cute stray cats roaming the streets. Sadly, they are not very friendly, but it's always nice to come across a random cat giving me a curious look. Plus, there are plenty of adorable dogs or cool birds around as you walk through the city.

9. **Food**: Food is surprisingly tasty and affordable. I'll share my favorite picks at the bottom of this blog post.

10. **Farmers Market**: Jinhae has a very famous farmers' market. It only opens on days that have a 3 or 8 in them, such as the 3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th, and so on. Many local farmers' markets in other cities have unfortunately been replaced by major grocery chains like Costco. Strangely and thankfully, however, despite the presence of a large grocery store literally right in front of this market, the market has thrived even more. It's a really fun place with lots of fresh veggies and food so if anyone's visiting, you should check it out.

### Cons
1. **Lodging**: Jinhae is not Cancun; it has only a handful of hotels, and in my opinion, they aren't great. It's a great place to live, but not necessarily the best for travel.

2. **Public Transportation**: While the bus system is efficient and taxis are relatively affordable, I wish there were more choices for public transportation. Currently the city is pretty car-centric. Ideally, a tram system would be great since there's already an existing railway infrastructure in place.

3. **Lack of The Long Term Vision of The City**: If I had the power, I would absolutely make sure that the city leaders preserve the current beauty of the city. Unfortunately, they've already massively destroyed a scenic part of the mountain to build apartment buildings, and they've polluted the ocean with shipbuilding infrastructure. While I understand the desire for short-term economic gains, I hope for a more far-sighted approach that minimizes the destruction of the existing beauty.

5. **Younger Generation**: I've noticed that the older folks in Jinhae are generally super chill - just really nice and sweet people. But the younger people there aren't as nice to engage in, for whatever reason. I hope they lighten up a bit.

6. **Language**: Most of the people do not speak English. While younger folks are more likely to know some English, be ready to use heavily on translation apps to communicate.
