### Some Pro Tips
1. my go-to approach is just directly asking locals. It's arguably the most fail-proof option compared to other online sources like blogs or news articles.
2. I'd say consider going to places other than Seoul as well. Seoul is beautiful of course, but I think the cities outside of Seoul is more charming at the end and a lot more affordable. Some of the cities I liked were:
    - Jinhae
    - Andong + Cheongsong + Yeongdeok
    - Suncheon
    - Gangneung
    - Gyeongju  
    - Some parts of Jeju Island
    
Let me explain more about these cities.

### Jinhae
A quaint harbor city that is surrounded by a magnificent mountain, it's a historic city known for its cherry blossom trees. For me, I love this city because it's beautiful and affordable.

There are so things to do: going to the sea, local markets full of fish, 600m mountains, cypress trees forest, lake, park, etc. You can easily find different kinds of unique birds and fish in the city, not to mention  stray cats and their kittens. Locals like growing fresh fruits and vegetables in their small gardens everywhere even in some parts of train rails. 

#### 1. Jujae Coffee
Hands down the best coffee shop in Jinhae or the whole country.

#### 2. Coffee Sunny
Also nice coffee place that is big and well-designed. Can also look at the ocean.

#### 3. Haneulchae
My favorite Bossam place (boiled pork)

#### 4. Yoon Baekjeong
The best pork belly place

#### 5. Jang cheon jip
Also nice pork belly place

#### 6. Dol dam gil
Really nice scallion pancakes and other food. Old and famous. You can even tell the taxi driver to go to "Dol Dam Gil" and they'll know.

#### 7. Imsil Cheese Pizza
Her pizza is delicious. She sometimes works until 4AM to meet the demand.

#### 8. Jinhae Soohyeop Fish market
Good place to buy Hwe (It's like sashimi). Good quality fish but you should probably need to speak in Korean and have a place to eat. It's just for take out.

#### 9. Cypress tree forest + Sammil Temple
Really beautiful forest full of cypress trees and cherry blossom trees. Sam-mil Temple is a good destination to visit too.

#### 10. Jinhae-roo
Nice jogging place overlooking the ocean

#### 11. Jangbok mountain (Shiri bong)
Beautiful mountain. There are 2 famous peaks: Shiri-bong and Cheonja-bong. It takes about 5 hours in total. Very fun!

#### 12. Anmin Gogae
It's a very curvy road to go to Changwon, a neighboring city. It's a good place to hike and see lots of cherry blossom trees. Can see the whole city from the top.

Famous town with traditional Korean buildings.
